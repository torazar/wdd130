    <p>This site is intended to be a rental service for board games
         here in Rexburg Idaho. You will be able to find several different
          board games which you will be able to rent for as low as $3 a day! 
          There is a commission fee, that will be returned to you after you
           return the game, so keep the game in one piece! </p>


    <p>So you might be wondering why we are renting board games?
         Board games are an incredible opportunity to mingle with those
          around you, without being focused on little screens in front of you.
           Board games tend to cause more face to face interaction between people 
           then video games, and are thus a good alternative. It is true that they
            can be expsensive, but that is why we exist! So you don't have to buy 
            them. </p>
