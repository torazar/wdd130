      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Are you aware of the financial opportunity that could come from a board game rental service here in Rexburg? Since I have a board game
           collection, I could start a rental service for board games, and people could try out many different board games without having to buy them.
            I intend to make a website to host this rental service, so that people can experience this opportunity. With this plan, people could easily find games
             they want to try, and they wouldn’t have to spend a lot to buy them.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is college students here in Rexburg. Other people might find the website and rent games, but the real target audience is the college students of BYUI.
          They will probably have the greatest demand for these games, and there will be plenty of options for them to try. The service will also be priced with this audience in mind,
          so even with their low amount of cash, it will still look interesting enough for them to try, Similarly to the events that happen on campus.

      <h4>Hello and welcome to Rexburg Board Games! </h4>
      <p>
        This site is intended to be a rental service for board games here in Rexburg Idaho. You will be able to find several
         different board games which you will be able to rent for as low as $3 a day! There is a commission fee, that will be returned 
         to you after you return the game, so keep the game in one piece!
         


      </p>
<p>
  Take a look at some games now!
</p>
<p>Here is a recomendation:</p>
      <p>
        So you might be wondering why we are renting board games? Board games are an incredible opportunity to mingle with those around you, without
        being focused on little screens in front of you. Board games tend to cause more face to face interaction between people then video games, and 
        are thus a good alternative. It is true that they can be expsensive, but that is why we exist! So you don't have to buy them.

      <h3>Tutorial Page</h3>
      <p>
        Dune Imperium is one of my favorite games, and is also one of my most complex. Therefore, it would help to have a video tutorial to give you a start!
        Just watch on, and see if you would enjoy the game!
      </p>
      <p>The Tutorial will only have a video.</p>
