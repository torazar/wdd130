            <p> I am a recently returned missionary who also happens to have worked last semester.
                I really enjoy board games, though I also like books and video games. But board games are my favorite.
            </p>
            <p>I have done a little bit of programming here and there, 
                and I am excited to work on html this semester. I think that this is a useful skill that could be a great help to my reprotiore.
            I hope that I can have some help from you all, though, as I don't really have all that much experience. This should be good!

            <p>Also, Pursuing my enjoyment of board games, I have a bit of a collection. I intend to attempt to found a renting service for my collection,
                 to give some students a few more options for playing games, and I think a website would be a very big help to that.
                    So, of course, I am going to try and set up said website for my final project. I hope it turns out well!
